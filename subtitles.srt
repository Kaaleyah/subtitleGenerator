1
0:00:03,890 --> 0:00:04,750
Do it.

2
0:00:05,960 --> 0:00:07,450
Just do it.

3
0:00:08,740 --> 0:00:11,130
Don't let your dreams be dreams.

4
0:00:11,800 --> 0:00:20,430
Yesterday you said tomorrow, so just do it. Make your dreams come true. Just do it.

5
0:00:23,100 --> 0:00:28,810
Some people dream success. While you're going to wake up and work hard at it, nothing is impossible.

6
0:00:30,900 --> 0:00:36,190
You should get to the point where anyone else would quit, and you're not gonna stop there.

7
0:00:36,830 --> 0:00:38,580
No. What are you waiting for?

8
0:00:39,720 --> 0:00:40,740
Do it.

9
0:00:42,550 --> 0:00:43,010
Just.

10
0:00:44,480 --> 0:00:48,630
Do it. Yes, you can. Just do it.

11
0:00:53,240 --> 0:00:54,880
If you're tired of starting over.

12
0:00:55,690 --> 0:00:57,970
Stop giving up.

13
0:00:58,010 --> 0:01:04,230
